# Hey👋
I'm `jewels86`! I'm a versatile developer specializing in C#.
You can check out my projects over at the [repositories tab](https://github.com/jewels86?tab=repositories) or on [my website](https://jewels86.me)!

### My Work
I mostly work with scientific computing and things of that nature; celestial mechanics, machine learning, things like that.
Recently, I've been branching out into general relativity for Axinite's V2 and learning a lot about ML for Opal.

### My Projects
Some things I'm currently working on:
- [**Opal**](https://github.com/jewels86/Opal): A deep learning and automatic differentiation library built for extensibility and performance.
- [**Lazulite**](https://github.com/jewels86/Lazulite): GPU-accelerated scientific computing for C#.
- [**ParaSharp**](https://github.com/jewels86/ParaSharp): Paravectors for the efficient storing of mathematical functions and other data.

Some things I've finished:
- [**Tourmaline**](https://github.com/jewels86/Tourmaline): A comprehensive and efficient web enumeration toolkit.
- [**Axinite**](https://github.com/jewels86/Axinite): A powerful open-source engine for advanced celestial mechanics.

### My Math Work
- [**ReX**](https://github.com/jewels86/ReX): A **Re**cursive e**X**ploration algorithm which finds the area of polygons.
- [**Paravectors**](https://github.com/jewels86/Paravectors): 3-component curved vectors for the description of systems.
