# Hey👋
I'm `jewels86`! I'm a versatile developer specializing in C#.
You can check out my projects over at the [repositories tab](https://github.com/jewels86?tab=repositories) or on [my website](https://jewels86.me)!

### My Work
I mostly work with scientific computing and things of that nature; celestial mechanics, machine learning, things like that.
Recently, I've been branching out into general relativity for Axinite's V2 and learning a lot about ML for Opal.

Some things I'm currently working on:
- [**Topaz**](https://github.com/jewels86/Topaz): Effortlessly manage both your work and life with one seamless platform (outside support wanted!).
- [**Opal**](https://github.com/jewels86/Opal): An all-in-one library of production-ready AI components.
- [**Axinite V2**](https://github.com/jewels86/Axinite): A powerful and open-source engine for efficiently simulating general relativity.
- [**Onyx**](https://github.com/jewels86/Onyx): Securing C# with secure-by-design and zero-trust principles

Some things I've finished:
- [**Tourmaline**](https://github.com/jewels86/Tourmaline): A comprehensive and effcient web enumeration toolkit.
- [**Axinite**](https://github.com/jewels86/Axinite): A powerful open-source engine for advanced celestial mechanics.
